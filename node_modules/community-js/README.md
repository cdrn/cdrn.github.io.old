# CommunityJS

## About
CommunityJS is a Javascript library to interact directly with the community contract, it handles all the communication between the frontend and the SmartWeave contract that's available on the permaweb.

## Documentation
We have in place a full documentation of the functions community.js offers.

To get started you need to have community-js installed on your webpage or server. You can do this by using nodejs with:
```
npm install community-js
```

Or you can use the currently permaweb version for your frontend.
