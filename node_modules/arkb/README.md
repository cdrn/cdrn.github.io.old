# arkb
Arweave Deploy that saves you data costs.

## Features
- No file size limit.
- No amount of files limit.
- Doesn't upload files that you have already uploaded.

## How to use
arkb runs using NodeJS and NPM. You must have both installed on your machine for it to work.

Install arkb:

```
yarn global add arkb # recommended
```

or

```
npm install -g arkb
```

> **Note:** The installation of arkb needs node >=15.11.0 or you will get an error when using `arkb`.  To manage multiple active nodejs, we recommend you have [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed on your computer, then you can switch different node in a simple command. 

And run:

```
arkb help
```

> **Note:** If you are planning to upload large batches of data transactions to the Arweave network, it is *strongly* advised that you use the `--use-bundler` option instead of regular deploy to avoid transaction failures. You can read about bundles and their advantages on the [Arwiki](https://arwiki.wiki/#/en/preview/WUAtjfiDQEIqhsUcHXIFTn5ZmeDIE7If9hJREBLRgak).
